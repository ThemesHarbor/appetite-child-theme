# Appetite child theme

The Appetite child theme is a starter blank child theme for the [Appetite WordPress theme](https://themesharbor.com/downloads/appetite/).

## Renaming _(optional)_

By default, GitHub adds "master" to the text of the zip file. You can rename the **zip** file of the child theme, so it is not called _appetite-child-master.zip_. It's better to have a folder that is called **appetite-child** rather than **appetite-child-master** because it makes more sense :)

## Installation

1. Download the child theme from this GitHub repository by clicking on a green button that says **Clone or download**. Once it's clicked, the page will show a modal window where you need to click **Download ZIP** in order to download a zip file.
2. Once you've downloaded a zip file, navigate to _WordPress dashboard > Appearance > Themes > Add New_.
3. Click **Upload Theme** and **Choose File**, then select a .zip file of the child theme that you've just downloaded. Click **Install Now**.
4. Click **Activate** to use your child theme.
